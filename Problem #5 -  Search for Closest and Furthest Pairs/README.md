# Problem #5: Search for Closest and Furthest Pairs

Write a program that reads in ten integers into an array. If there are any duplicates in the array,
display a message and terminate the program. Otherwise search that array for the pair of distinct
integers that are numerically closest together and the pair that is numerically furthest apart. If
there is more one pair of either kind, choose the pair containing the element that appears first in
the list. Finally, display those two pairs.

The following are two sample runs of this program:
```
Enter 10 integers: 34 83 92 12 29 123 16 83 98 16
Array contains duplicates

Enter 10 integers: 13 95 187 25 141 26 98 24 94 48
Pair numerically closest together is: 95 94
Pair numerically furthest apart is: 13 187
